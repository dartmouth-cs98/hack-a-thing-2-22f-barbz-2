# Hack Technology / Project Attempted
VR, Building a Museum with Unity3D
AR, Mobile Applications using Unity

## What you built?

TODO: Short description of what you attempted to build
We built a VR Museum from scratch using Unity3D.  

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

TODO: who worked on what part?
Melissa and Will pair programmed both projects. Melissa generally focused on the VR Museum, while Will dove into the AR Mobile Applications. We both followed the tutorials alongside one another, ensuring we downloaded the necessary software and dependencies in case we ran into any individual issues and thus would be able to pick up on either one's work space.

## What you learned

TODO: what worked / what didn't work
The Museum VR Tutorial was a great introduction to working with Unity 3D and creating a virtual reality space. We initially began with creating a confined space using the Unity Cube 3D object. This required manipulating the object's position to align what would become the walls, and roof of the museum. We used a wood-resembling material to alter the museum floor which was a Unity plane. It was interesting to learn how to use these built-in objects and apply materials to enhance how realistic they appear. 

- displays various artifacts
- has built-in sound for the descriptions
- learned how to apply area lighting
- worked with more materials
- learned more about resolutions
